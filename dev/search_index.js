The initial state of the surface is specified using the XML element <initial>. The sum of coverages mentioned in the <initial> elements must add up to 1.0.

The stoichiometry and the parameters are separated by the ‘@‘ symbol. A ‘=>’ symbol in the stoichiometry represents a forward reaction. If reverse reactions need to be specified, the user must ensure that the NASA polynomials are available for the surface adsorbed species. Three parameters can be specified after the ‘@‘ symbol. The first parameter specifies the sticking coefficient, the second is the temperature dependency of the sticking coefficient, and the third is the activation energy. Generally, sticking reactions are specified only the sticking coefficient, and in case the other two parameters are specified, then the rate constant will be modified accordingly.
